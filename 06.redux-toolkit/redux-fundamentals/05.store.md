# Redux Store

- There is always a single store in a redux application. Cannot split the store like reducers.
- Some of the responsibilities of store are
- To hold the current application state.
- Allows access to read current state via `store.getState()`.
- Allows state to be updated via `store.dispatch()`.
- Registers listener callbacks via `store.subscribe(listener)`;
- Handles unregistering of listeners via the unsubscribe function returned by` store.subscribe(listener)`.


## Creating a Store

- Every Redux store has a single root reducer function.

```ts
const store = createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState)

```
