# Pieces of Redux

## 1. The Redux Store

- Store is a container which holds global application state.
- Structurewise, Store is a JavaScript object.
- We never mutate this store data directly to update application state.

## 2. Actions and dispatchers

- Actions are plain JavaScript objects with a `type` and a `payload` field that describes `something has happened in the application` and application state needs to be updated in response.
- The `type` field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name, like "todos/todoAdded". We usually write that type string like "domain/eventName", where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to, and the second part is the specific thing that happened.
- An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called `payload`.
- This action object is then passed to store via dispatchers.

```js
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}
```

## 3. Reducer function

- To determines the new state when something happens in the app.
- It takes two arguments current state and action object.
- When an action is dispatched to the store, it runs the reducer function to calculate the new state and updates the store.
-  Note that we update the state immutably by copying the existing state and updating the copy, instead of modifying the original object directly.
- Finally, the store notifies subscribers that the state has been updated so the UI can be updated with the new data.

## Data Flow

- actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
- the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
- the UI reads the new state to display the new values


## Steps for implmemntation

- Create an `initial state` for your application. Generally we create an object as our application state and add properties to it.
- Create a `Reducer` function. The reducer receives two arguments, the current state and an action object describing what happened. When the app starts, we do not have any value for state, so we use initialState as the defaulkt value to a reducer.
- Now that we have a reducer function, we can create a store instance by calling the Redux library createStore API. We pass the reducer function to createStore, which uses the reducer function to generate the initial state, and to calculate any future updates.
- Finally, we need to respond to user input by creating action objects that describe what happened, and dispatching them to the store. When we call store.dispatch(action), the store runs the reducer, calculates the updated state, and runs the subscribers to update the UI.
