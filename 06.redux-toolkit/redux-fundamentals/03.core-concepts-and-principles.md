# Core Concepts and Principles


## Single Source of Truth

- The global application state is present in one central place - The Redux Store.


## State is Read-Only

- The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, an object that describes what happened.


## Changes are Made with Pure Reducer Functions

- Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.
