## 1. Designing the State Values

- The first step is to figure out the application state and it's structure.
- The app state is always a plain JavaScript object with multiple state values nested inside  it.

```ts
export interface ITodo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  color: TodoColors;
  completed: boolean;
}

export type TodoStatus = "All" | "Active" | "Completed";

export type TodoColors =
  | "Red"
  | "Yellow"
  | "Green"
  | "Blue"
  | "Orange"
  | "Purple";

export interface ITodoAppState {
  todos: ITodo[];
  filters: {
    status: TodoStatus;
    colors: TodoColors[];
  };
}
```

```ts
import { ITodoAppState } from "./model";

export const todoAppState: ITodoAppState = {
  todos: [],
  filters: {
    status: "All",
    colors: [],
  },
};

```


## 2. Designing Actions

- Think about all the possible user interactions.
- Based on that list of things that can happen, we can create a list of actions that our application will use.
- Choose proper naming conventions and figure out the payload structure.


### Possible user interactions

- Add a new todo entry based on the text the user entered
- Toggle the completed status of a todo
- Select a color category for a todo
- Delete a todo
- Mark all todos as completed
- Clear all completed todos
- Choose a different "completed" filter value
- Add a new color filter
- Remove a color filter

###  list of actions based on user interactions

- `{type: 'todos/todoAdded', payload: todoText}`
- `{type: 'todos/todoToggled', payload: todoId}`
- `{type: 'todos/colorSelected', payload: {todoId, color}}`
- `{type: 'todos/todoDeleted', payload: todoId}`
- `{type: 'todos/allCompleted'}`
- `{type: 'todos/completedCleared'}`
- `{type: 'filters/statusFilterChanged', payload: filterValue}`
- `{type: 'filters/colorFilterChanged', payload: {color, changeType}}`
