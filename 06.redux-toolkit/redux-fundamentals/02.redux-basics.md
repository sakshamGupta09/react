# Pieces of Redux

## 1. The Redux Store

- Store is a container which holds global application state.
- Structurewise, Store is a JavaScript object.
- We never mutate this store data directly to update application state.

## 2. Actions and dispatchers

- Actions are objects that describes `something has happened in the application` and I need to inform my store about it.
- Each action object will have a `type` property to describe about the type of event that has happened.
- Value of type is a string that should be a readable name that describes what has happened in the application. `counter/incremented`
- This action object is then passed to store via dispatchers.

## 3. Reducer function

- To determines the new state when something happens in the app.
- It takes two arguments current state and action object.
- When an action is dispatched to the store, it runs the reducer function to calculate the new state and updates the store.
-  Note that we update the state immutably by copying the existing state and updating the copy, instead of modifying the original object directly.
- Finally, the store notifies subscribers that the state has been updated so the UI can be updated with the new data.

## Data Flow

- actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
- the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
- the UI reads the new state to display the new values


## Steps for implmemntation

- Create an `initial state` for your application. Generally we create an object as our application state and add properties to it.
- Create a `Reducer` function. The reducer receives two arguments, the current state and an action object describing what happened. When the app starts, we do not have any value for state, so we use initialState as the defaulkt value to a reducer.
