# Pieces of Redux

## 1. The Redux Store

- Store is a container which holds global application state.
- Structurewise, Store is a JavaScript object.
- We never mutate this store data directly to update application state.
- The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called `getState` that returns the current state value.

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer })

console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 0}
```

## 2. Actions

- Actions are plain JavaScript objects with a `type` and a `payload` field that describes `something has happened in the application` and application state needs to be updated in response.
- The `type` field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name, like `todos/todoAdded`. We usually write that `type` string like `domain/eventName`, where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to, and the second part is the specific thing that happened.
- An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called `payload`.

```js
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}
```

## 3. Reducer function

- Reducer is a function that takes `current state` and `action` object as arguments and returns a new state.
- `(state, action) => newState`


### Reducers must always follow some specific rules:

- They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments.
- They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.
- They must not do any asynchronous logic, calculate random values, or cause other "side effects"

```js
const initialState = { value: 0 }

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
  if (action.type === 'counter/incremented') {
    // If so, make a copy of `state`
    return {
      ...state,
      // and update the copy with the new value
      value: state.value + 1
    }
  }
  // otherwise return the existing state unchanged
  return state
}
```

## 4. Dispatch

- The Redux store has a method called dispatch. The only way to update the state is to call `store.dispatch()` and pass in an action object.
- The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside.
- You can think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event" in the application. Reducers act like event listeners, and when they hear an action they are interested in, they update the state in response.

## 5. Selectors

- Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value.
- As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data.

```js
const selectCounterValue = state => state.value

const currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState())
console.log(currentValue)
```

## Data Flow

- actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
- the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
- the UI reads the new state to display the new values
