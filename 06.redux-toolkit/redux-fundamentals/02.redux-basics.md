# Pieces of Redux

## 1. The Redux Store

- Store is a container which holds global application state.
- Structurewise, Store is a JavaScript object.
- We never mutate this store data directly to update application state.

## 2. Actions and dispatchers

- Actions are objects that describes `something has happened in the application` and I need to inform my store about it.
- Each action object will have a `type` property to describe about the type of event that has happened.
- This action object is then passed to store via dispatchers.

## 3. Reducer function

- The logic to update the state or store is written in a function called Reducer.
- It takes two arguments current state and action object.
- When an action is dispatched to the store, it runs the reducer function to calculate the new state and updates the store.
- Finally, the store notifies subscribers that the state has been updated so the UI can be updated with the new data.

## Data Flow

- actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
- the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
- the UI reads the new state to display the new values
