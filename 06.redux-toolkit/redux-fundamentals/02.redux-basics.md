# Pieces of Redux

## The Redux Store

- Store is a container which holds global application state.
- Structurewise, Store is a JavaScript object.

## Actions and dispatchers

- Actions are objects that describes `something has happened in the application`.
- Each action object will have a `type` property to describe about the type of event that has happened.
- This action object is then passed to store via dispatchers.

## Data Flow

- actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
- the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
- the UI reads the new state to display the new values
