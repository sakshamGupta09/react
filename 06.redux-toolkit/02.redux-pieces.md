# Pieces of Redux

- **Store:** Store is a container that holds our application state(golbal data). It's a JavaScript object.
- **Actions:** Action is an object that describes something that happened in the application.
- **Dispatch:** The action object is dispatched to the store to tell it about what has happened.
- **Reducer:** When an action is dispatched, the store runs the reducer function, and lets it calculate the new state based on the old state and the action.
