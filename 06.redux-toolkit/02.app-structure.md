# The Counter Example App


## Designing the state structure

- Think of the minimal data needed for the app to work.
- Spend some good amount of time and keep refactoring and refining the state structure.


## Redux Slices

- Our application state can have different independent features.
- For each independent feature, we create a slice that manages that feature.
- A slice is a collection of `reducer` and `actions` for a single feature typically defined together in a single file.


For example, in a blogging app, our store setup might look like:

```ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import usersReducer from '../features/users/usersSlice'
import postsReducer from '../features/posts/postsSlice'
import commentsReducer from '../features/comments/commentsSlice'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    users: usersReducer,
    posts: postsReducer,
    comments: commentsReducer
  }
})
```
