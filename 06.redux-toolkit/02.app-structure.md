# The Counter Example App


## Designing the state structure

- Think of the minimal data needed for the app to work.
- Spend some good amount of time and keep refactoring and refining the state structure.


## Redux Slices

- Our application state can have different independent features.
- For each independent feature, we create a slice that manages that feature.
- A slice is a collection of `reducer` and `actions` for a single feature typically defined together in a single file.
