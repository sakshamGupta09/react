# Global Application State

- Shared data that can be accessed by multiple components in an application.
- This data can be modified by multiple components and the changes should reflect instantly across the application.

## Examples

- Theme color
- Locale
- Permissions
- Logged in user information
- Roles


## Challenges

- How to store the global state.
- How can components read global state.
- How can components update global state.
- How to inform listeners about the state change.


## Redux

- Redux is a pattern and library for managing global application state.
- Where to store data, how to read data, update it and inform listeners about data change everything is managed by Redux.


## State Management

```tsx
function Counter() {
  // State: a counter value
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  // Action: code that causes an update to the state when something happens
  const increment = () => {
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
  }

  // View: the UI definition
  return (
    <div>
      Value: {counter} <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- This application has three parts
- `The state`, the data in our application at a given time.
- `The view`, the UI that is rendered using current state of application.
- `The actions`, the user interactions that causes us to update the application state and rerender UI.
