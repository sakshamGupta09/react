# What is Global Application State?

- I have some application level data that multiple components can read or update.
- It's like a single source of truth for an app that everyone can read or update.

## Examples

- Logged-in user info (username, token)
- Theme (light/dark mode) of application.
- Language or locale of application.
- User permissions/roles of user logged into the application.


## What is redux

- Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating global application state in a predictable way.

## When Should I Use Redux?
