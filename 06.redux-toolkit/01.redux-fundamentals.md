# What is Global Application State?

- I have some application level data that multiple components can read or update.
- It's like a single source of truth for an app that everyone can read or update.

## Examples

- Logged-in user info (username, token)
- Theme (light/dark mode)
- Language or locale
- User permissions/roles
