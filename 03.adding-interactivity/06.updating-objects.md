# Updating Objects in State

## What’s a mutation? 

- Some values in JavaScript are immutable like strings, numbers and booleans.
- These values never change. It's not possible to make changes to these values.

Now consider an object in state. Technically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a mutation:

```tsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

```tsx
position.x = 5;
```
