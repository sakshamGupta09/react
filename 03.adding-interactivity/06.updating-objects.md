# Updating Objects in State


## Immutable types in JavaScript

- Number, string and boolean are immutable.
- They are readonly. It is impossible to change these values. We can replace their value but not chamge it.


## Mutable types

```tsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

position.x = 5;
```

- It is possible to change properties of an object. This is called a mutation.



## Treat state as read-only 

- All state in React should be treated as readonly and immutable.
- Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.

## 1. Create a new object

```tsx
setPosition({
  x: e.clientX,
  y: e.clientY
});
```
- State is readonly. We must replace it with a new object.


## 2. Copying objects with the spread syntax 

- If the object has very few properties and you are able to provide value for each of them, create a new object.
- Often we need existing data and update only one or two properties from it.
- In that case we create a new object and copy all the values from previous object.
- For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields.

```tsx
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

// WRONG
setPerson({
  firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input
  lastName: person.lastName,
  email: person.email
});

setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy the old fields
  firstName: e.target.value // But override this one
});
```
