# Updating Objects in State

## What’s a mutation? 

- Some values in JavaScript are immutable like strings, numbers and booleans.
- These values never change. It's not possible to make changes to these values.

Now consider an object in state. Technically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a mutation:

```tsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

```tsx
position.x = 5;
```
- However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings.
-  Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.
-  If we mutate objects directly without setter function, React will not know that state has changed and no render will be triggered.


## Treat state as read-only 

- Treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only.
