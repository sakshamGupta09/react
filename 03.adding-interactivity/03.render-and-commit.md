# Render and Commit

- To display any component on the screen, there is a three step process.
- We automatically see the output on the screen but what happens behind the scenes?


## Step 1: Trigger a render 

- There are two factors that can trigger a render.
- It’s the component’s initial render.
- The component’s state has been updated.

### Initial render 

- When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render.

```tsx
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);
```

### Re-renders when state updates 

- Whenever a component's state changes or one of it's ancestor's state changes a render is triggered.

## Step 2: React renders your components 

- After you trigger a render, React calls that component to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components and analysing the JSX we return.
- On initial render, React will call the root component.
- For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.
- This process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render that component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render that component next, and so on.
- Entire subtree is rendered again bu updating state of a parent.
- During the initial render, React will create the DOM nodes for `<section>`, `<h1>`, and three `<img>` tags.
- During a re-render, React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won’t do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase.
