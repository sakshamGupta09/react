# Render and Commit

- To display components on the screen, React follows a three step process.


## Step 1: Trigger a render 

There are two reasons for a component to render:

1. It’s the component’s initial render.
2. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.


## Step 2: React renders your components 

- “Rendering” is React calling your components to figure out what to display on screen.
- This process is recursive.
- If the updated component returns some other component, React will render that component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render that component next, and so on.
- The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen.
- During the initial render, React will create the DOM nodes for `<section>`, `<h1>`, and three `<img>` tags.
- During a re-render, React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won’t do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase.

### Rendering must always be a pure calculation.


## Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM 

- React will modify the DOM in this step.
- **For the initial render**, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
- **For re-renders**, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.
- React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders.
