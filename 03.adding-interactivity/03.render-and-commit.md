# Render and Commit

- To display any component on the screen, there is a three step process.
- We automatically see the output on the screen but what happens behind the scenes?


## Step 1: Trigger a render 

- There are two factord that can trigger a render.
- It’s the component’s initial render.
- The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.
- Both of these triggers a render.

## Step 2: React renders your components 

- After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components.
