# Render and Commit

- To display any component on the screen, there is a three step process.
- We automatically see the output on the screen but what happens behind the scenes?


## Step 1: Trigger a render 

- There are two factors that can trigger a render.
- It’s the component’s initial render.
- The component’s state has been updated.

### Initial render 

- When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render.

```tsx
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);
```

### Re-renders when state updates 

- Whenever a component's state changes or one of it's ancestor's state changes a render is triggered.

## Step 2: React renders your components 

- After you trigger a render for a component, React calls that component to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components and analysing the JSX we return.
- This process is recursive. All the components nested inside are also rendered.
- During initial render, React will create DOM nodes like `section`, `h1` etc.
- During a re-render React will compare the old tree from previous render with the new one and calculate what changes need to be made.
- The default behavior of rendering all components nested within the updated component is not optimal for performance if the updated component is very high in the tree.

## Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM 

- After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.
- For the initial render, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
- For re-renders, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.
- React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders.
