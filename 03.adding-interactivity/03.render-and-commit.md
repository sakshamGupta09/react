# Render and Commit

- To display any component on the screen, there is a three step process.
- We automatically see the output on the screen but what happens behind the scenes?


## Step 1: Trigger a render 

- There are two factord that can trigger a render.
- It’s the component’s initial render.
- The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.
- Both of these triggers a render.

### Initial render 

- When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render.

```tsx
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);
```

### Re-renders when state updates 

- Whenever a component's state changes or one of it's ancestor's state changes a render is triggered.

## Step 2: React renders your components 

- After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components and analysing the JSX we return.
