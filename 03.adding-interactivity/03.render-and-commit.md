# Render and Commit

- To display components on the screen, React follows a three step process.


## Step 1: Trigger a render 

There are two reasons for a component to render:

1. It’s the component’s initial render.
2. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.


## Step 2: React renders your components 

- “Rendering” is React calling your components to figure out what to display on screen.
- This process is recursive.
- If the updated component returns some other component, React will render that component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render that component next, and so on.
- The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen.
