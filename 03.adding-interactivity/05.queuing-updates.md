# React batches state updates 

- When we use state setter, React does not immideately starts processing state updates.
- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. After handler is done React starts processing all the state updates made in that handler call.
- This lets us update multiple state variables without too many renders. Example consider setting a loader, data and error variables in an event handler. If React starts processing state updates immidiately, there will be too many renders and half finished renders where only some of the variables have been updated..


## Updating the same state multiple times before the next render 

```tsx
setCount(count+1);
setCount(count+1);
setCount(count+1);
```

- We know that inside an event handler, state is always fixed.
- If we try to set state multiple times, it will always give same result. So, what's the solution then?
