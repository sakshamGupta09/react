# React batches state updates 

- If we have multiple setState calls or even a single call, React does not immideately starts processing state updates.
- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.
- This lets us update multiple state variables without too many renders. Example consider setting a loader, data and error variables in an event handler. If React starts processing state updates immidiately, there will be too many renders and half finished renders.
