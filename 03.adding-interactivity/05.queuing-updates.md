# React batches state updates 

- It's not like React will trigge a new render everytime you call setState.
- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates (re-rendering).
- This lets you update multiple state variables without trigerring too many renders.
- But this also means that the UI won’t be updated until after your event handler, and any code in it, completes.
- It also avoids dealing with confusing “half-finished” renders where only some of the variables have been updated.
- This behavior is called Batching.
