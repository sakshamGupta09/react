# React batches state updates 

- When we use state setter, React does not immideately starts processing state updates.
- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. After handler is done React starts processing all the state updates made in that handler call.
- This lets us update multiple state variables without too many renders. Example consider setting a loader, data and error variables in an event handler. If React starts processing state updates immidiately, there will be too many renders and half finished renders where only some of the variables have been updated..


## Updating the same state multiple times before the next render 

```tsx
setCount(count+1);
setCount(count+1);
setCount(count+1);
```

- State is a snapshot. During a render React gives us a state value and creates event hanlders inside which state value will always be fixed for that render.
- So, we cannot update a state variable multiple times.
- Instead of passing next state value like `setCount(1)`, we can pass a updator function that calculates next state based on previous state in the queue like `setNumber(n => n + 1)`.


## How React processes state updates

- After all code in the event handler has executed, React will look at all state update calls and add it to a queue.
- And a render is triggered as we updated the state.
- During next render, React processes this queue and gives us a state value.

```tsx
setNumber(n => n + 1)
setNumber(n => n + 1)
setNumber(n => n + 1)
```

- `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
- `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
- `n => n + 1` is a function. React adds it to a queue.
- During next render, when we call `useState`, React goes through this queue.

| Queued Update   | n (before) | Returns      |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| `n => n + 1`   | 0          | `0 + 1 = 1`   |
| `n => n + 1`   | 1          | `1 + 1 = 2`   |
| `n => n + 1`   | 2          | `2 + 1 = 3`   |


## What happens if you update state after replacing it 

```tsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}>

```

- `setNumber(number + 5)`: number is 0, so `setNumber(0 + 5)`. React adds “replace with 5” to its queue.
- `setNumber(n => n + 1)`: `n => n + 1` is an updater function. React adds that function to its queue.
- During the next render, React goes through the state queue:

| Queued Update     | n (before) | Returns    |
|------------------|------------|-------------|
| "replace with 5" | 0 (unused) | 5           |
| `n => n + 1`     | 5          | `5 + 1 = 6` |
