# React batches state updates 

```tsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
- We learnt that when the event handler ran, the value of number was 0 which will remain constant throughout the render.
- So, it was like calling setNumber(0+1) three times.
- When we use setState with a value, during the next render, React just replaces the state value with the value provided.
- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. This behavior is known as batching.


## Updating the same state multiple times before the next render 

```tsx
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
setNumber(0 + 1);
```

- Updating a same state variable multiple times is not possible.
- Because React just replaces the state variable with the value passed to setState call.
- To update the same state variable multiple times before the next render.
