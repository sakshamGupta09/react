# Queueing a Series of State Updates

## React batches state updates 

```tsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
- We learnt that when the event handler ran, the value of number was 0 which will remain constant throughout the render.
- So, it was like calling setNumber(0+1) three times.
- React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. This behavior is known as batching.
