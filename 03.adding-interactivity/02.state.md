# State: A Component's Memory

- Components need to remember some information. Like list of users, current page, page size, search term etc.


## Problems with local variables

- Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders a component again, all local data will be reset and reinitialized.
- Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. So, even if the variable is updated, the UI will not reflect the changes.
