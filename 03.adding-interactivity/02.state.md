# State: A Component's Memory

- Components need to remember some information. Like list of users, current page, page size, search term etc.


## Problems with local variables

- Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders a component again, all local data will be reset and reinitialized.
- Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. So, even if the variable is updated, the UI will not reflect the changes. Model and view go out of sync.


## useState 

- This is the problem that useState hook solves.
- `useState` is a function that returns an array of two things a state variable and a setter function.
- It gives us a state variable to retain the data between renders.
- A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again with new value. Model and view are always in sync.
- The convention is to name this pair like const [something, setSomething].
