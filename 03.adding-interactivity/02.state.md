# State: A Component's Memory


## When a regular variable isn’t enough 

- Local variables don't retain their values between renders. Every new render will invoke the function again and reinitialzie their values.
- Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. So, if we are displaying this data on the UI, UI will not be updated when we update the variable.

## useState Hook

- `useState` hook solves these two problems. It provides us -
- A state variable to retain the data between renders.
- A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
- `useState` is a function that takes initial value as input and returns us an array of two items. A state variable and a setter function.
- The convention is to name this pair like const `[something, setSomething]`.

Every time your component renders, useState gives you an array containing two values:

- The state variable (index) with the value you stored.
- The state setter function (setIndex) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleIncremenetClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>{index}</p>
      <button onClick={handleIncremenetClick}>Increment Count</button>
    </>
  );
}

```

## State is isolated and private 

- State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.
