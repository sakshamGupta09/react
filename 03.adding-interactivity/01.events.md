# Responding to Events

- Declare a function inside the component and write it's implementation.
- Pass this function as a prop to JSX element.
- Whenever the event is triggered, React will invoke the function passed.
- Problem with this approach is how to pass arguments.

```tsx
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}

```

## Inline event handler

- This impacts the readability. Our markup can look messy if we write all event handlers code inside markup.
- There is no seperation.

```tsx
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>

<button onClick={() => {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

## Mix of both worlds

```tsx

export default function App() {
  function handleDivClick() {
    console.log("[DIV CLICKED]");
  }

  return <div onClick={() => handleDivClick()}></div>;
}
```

## Naming convention

- It is common to name event handlers as handle followed by the event name. You’ll often see `onClick={handleClick}`, `onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}`, and so on.
- If there are multiple buttons, we can call them `handleButtonNameClick`.


## Pitfall

- Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called.
- We are just passing a function to React saying that please invoke it once the event is trigggered.
- We do not want to execute it right away or on every render.

```tsx
<button onClick={handleClick()}>
```

- This is wrong.
- Passing functions like this won’t fire on click of it but every time the component renders.


## Passing event handlers as props 

- Often you’ll want the parent component to specify a child’s event handler.
- There is some event happening in child, and it wants to tell parent about it. We want to run some logic in parent in response to an event in child.
- Consider a generic `Button` component. This component will be used at multiple places. But on every page it does something different when clicked. 


## Event propagation 

- Event handlers will also catch events from any children your component might have.
- An event “bubbles” or “propagates” up the tree: it starts with where the event happened, and then goes up the tree.
- Be careful and add handlers only to specific components like buttons and not on generic ones.

```tsx
export default function List() {
  function handleDivClick() {
    console.log("[DIV CLICKED]");
  }

  function handleButton1Click() {
    console.log("[BUTTON 1 CLICKED]");
  }

  function handleButton2Click() {
    console.log("[BUTTON 2 CLICKED]");
  }
  return (
    <div onClick={handleDivClick}>
      <button onClick={handleButton1Click}>BUTTON 1</button>
      <button onClick={handleButton2Click}>BUTTON 2</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

## Stopping propagation 

- Event handlers receive an event object as their only argument. When React calls our function, it invokes it with an event object.

```tsx
  function handleButton1Click(e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) {
    console.log("[BUTTON 1 CLICKED]");
    e.stopPropagation();
  }
```

## Passing handlers as alternative to propagation 

- We were passing event handlers as props to child components.
- But why don't we use propogation instead? Whenever child component triggers an event it will be captured by parent.
- So why pass the vent handler?
- you can clearly follow the whole chain of code that executes as a result of some event.
- If you rely on propagation and it’s difficult to trace which handlers execute and why, try this approach instead.


## Can event handlers have side effects? 

- Absolutely! Event handlers are the best place for side effects.
- Event handlers are not part of rendering logic. They get invoked in response to a certain interaction.
