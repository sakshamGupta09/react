# Responding to Events

- Declare a function inside the component and write it's implementation.
- Pass this function as a prop to JSX element.
- Whenever the event is triggered, React will invoke the function passed.

```tsx
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}

```

## Inline event handler

```tsx
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>

<button onClick={() => {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

## Naming convention

- It is common to name event handlers as handle followed by the event name. You’ll often see `onClick={handleClick}`, `onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}`, and so on.


## Pitfall

- Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called.
- We are just passing a function to React saying that please invoke it once the event is trigggered.

```tsx
<button onClick={handleClick()}>
```

- This is wrong.
- Passing functions like this won’t fire on click of it but every time the component renders.
