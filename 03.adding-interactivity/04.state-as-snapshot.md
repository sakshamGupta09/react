# State as a Snapshot

- State behaves more like a snapshot. When React renders a component, during that rendering, state always remain same like a snapshot.
- All the event handlers will use the same snapshot during a render.
- Setting state does not change the state variable we already have, but instead triggers a re-render.
- Now React will render our component again and call the `useState` hook to give us the latest value of state variable.


```tsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Notice that number only increments once per click!
- Setting state only changes it for the next render.
- During the first render, number was 0. This is why, in that renderâ€™s `onClick` handler, the value of number is still 0 because state remains constant during a render.
