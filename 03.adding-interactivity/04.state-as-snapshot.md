# State as a Snapshot

- State acts like a snapshot. It does not update and stays constant for a render.
- State does not live in a component but inside React.
- When React calls our component, it gives us a snapshot of state for that particular render.
- Setting state does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render.
- During next render we ask `useState` to give us a new value which it calculates using a queue.



```tsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}

```

- Calling `setCount` only triggers a render. That's all. It doesn't update any values.
- Also state acts like a snapshot. During a render it remains unchanged.
- So, the value of count is 0 for initial render. So, the event handler will also receive 0 as state value.

```
setCount(0+1)
setCount(0+1)
setCount(0+1)
```
- Even though we call `setCount` 3 times, We are always asking React to give us a value of 0+1 as new state during next render.
