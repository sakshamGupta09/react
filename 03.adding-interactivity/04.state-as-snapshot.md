# State as a Snapshot

- State behaves more like a snapshot. When React renders a component, during that rendering state always remain same like a snapshot.
- Setting state does not change the state variable we already have, but instead triggers a re-render.
- Now React will render our component again and call the `useState` hook to give us the latest value of state variable.
