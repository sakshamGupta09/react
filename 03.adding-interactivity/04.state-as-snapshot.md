# State as a Snapshot

- When React renders a component, it reads the value of state variable from `useState` function and that state always remain same during that render.
- Setting state does not change the state variable we already have, but instead triggers a re-render.
- Now React will render our component again and call the `useState` hook to give us the latest value of state variable.
- If we update the state inside an event handler, first all the code inside the handler will execute with the same value of state and then React will render our component again with new state value.


```tsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Notice that number only increments once per click!
- Setting state only changes it for the next render.
- During the first render, number was 0. This is why, in that render’s `onClick` handler, the value of number is still 0 because state remains constant during a render.

1. setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1). React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
2. setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1). React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.
3. setNumber(number + 1): number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1). React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render.

- Even though you called setNumber(number + 1) three times, in this render’s event handler number is always 0, so you set the state to 1 three times.

```tsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

For the next render, number is 1, so that render’s click handler looks like this:

```tsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```


## State over time 

- If we are setting state inside an event handler, the setState will only trigger a re-render and not update that state variable instantly.
- After the handler code is finished, recat will render the component again.

```tsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        alert(number);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
- If we use the substitution method, the state variable has a value of 0.

```tsx
setNumber(0 + 5);
alert(0);
```
