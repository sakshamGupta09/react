# Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state 

- We render the UI based on some data model. When the users interact with our webpage, we need to change our data model so that the rendered UI also changes.
- We use state for this.
- Data in our application that changes over time is called state.

## How to identify state

- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
- Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!



## Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

1. The original list of products
2. The search text the user has entered
3. The value of the checkbox
4. The filtered list of products
