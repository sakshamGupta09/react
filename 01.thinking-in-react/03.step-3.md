# Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state 

- We render the UI based on some data model. When the users interact with our webpage, we need to change our data model so that the rendered UI also changes.
- We use state for this. Goal of this step is to identify state.
- Data in our application that changes over time is called state.
- Identify all pieces of data used in the application.
- Figure out which out of them should be state.

## How to identify state

- It changes over time.
- Cannot be derived from props.
- Cannot be computed from existing state or props in your component.



## Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

1. The original list of products
2. The search text the user has entered
3. The value of the checkbox
4. The filtered list of products


## Which of these are state

1. The original list of products is passed in as props, so it’s not state.
2. The search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.
3. The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.
4. The filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.
