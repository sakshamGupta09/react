# Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state 

- We render the UI based on some data model. When the users interact with our webpage, we need to change our data model so that the rendered UI also changes.
- We use state for this. Goal of this step is to identify state.
- Data in our application that changes over time is called state.
- Identify all pieces of data used in the application.
- Figure out which out of them should be state.

## How to identify state

- It changes over time.
- Cannot be derived from props.
- Cannot be computed from existing state or props in your component.



## Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

1. The original list of products
2. The search text the user has entered
3. The value of the checkbox
4. The filtered list of products


## Which of these are state

-
