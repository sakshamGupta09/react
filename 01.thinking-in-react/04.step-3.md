# Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state 

- To make UI interactive, we need state which changes in response to user interactions.

## How to identify state

- It changes over time.
- Cannot be derived or computed from props.
- Cannot be computed from existing state or props in your component.


## Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

1. The original list of products
2. The search text the user has entered
3. The value of the checkbox
4. The filtered list of products


## Which of these are state

1. The original list of products is **passed in as props, so it’s not state**.
2. The search text seems to be state since it **changes over time and can’t be computed from anything**.
3. The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything.
4. The filtered list of products isn’t state because **it can be computed** by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox.
5. This means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done!
