# Step 5: Add inverse data flow 

- We rendered our app with data flowing from top to bottom. Now we need to change our state in response to user interactions.
- But since we have a hierarchy of components, it is possible that user interaction happens in a component which is not managing state.
- So, we need to support the data flow in the other direction too. The form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in   `FilterableProductTable`.
