# Step 4: Identify where your state should live 

- After we identify what state of our application is, we need to identify the components where each state should live.
- React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. So, it is important where we place our state.

## How to identify components which own state

### For each piece of state in your application:

1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2. Find their closest common parent component.
3. Decide where the state should live:
    1. Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
    2. You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
    3. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.


## Let's test this approach with our example application

1. Identify components that use state:
    - `ProductTable` needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).
    - `SearchBar` needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).
2. Find their closest common parent:
    - The first parent component both components share is `FilterableProductTable`.
3. Decide where the state lives
    - We’ll keep the filter text and checked state values in `FilterableProductTable`.
