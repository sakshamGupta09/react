# Step 4: Identify where your state should live 

- After we identify what state of our application is, we need to identify the components where each state should live.
- React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. So, it is important where we place our state.

## How to identify components which own state

### For each piece of state in your application:

1. Identify every component that ruses this state variable
2. Find their closest common parent component.
3. Put thestate into the common parent.

## Let's test this approach with our example application

1. Identify components that use state:
    - `ProductTable` needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value).
    - `SearchBar` needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value).
2. Find their closest common parent:
    - The first parent component both components share is `FilterableProductTable`.
3. Decide where the state lives
    - Weâ€™ll keep the filter text and checked state values in `FilterableProductTable`. 


``` TSX
function FilterableProductTable({ products }) {
  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');
  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);
```
