# Step 4: Identify where your state should live 

- After we identify what state of our application is, we need to identify the components where each state should live.
- React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component.

## How to identify components which own state

### For each piece of state in your application:

1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2. Find their closest common parent component.
3. Decide where the state should live:
    1. Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
    2. You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
    3. If you canâ€™t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.
