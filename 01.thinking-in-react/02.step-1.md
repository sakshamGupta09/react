# Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy 

- Split up a UI design into components based on `Single Responsibility Principle` and name them appropriately.
- A component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up doing multiple things, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them.
- Arrange them into a tree hierarchy.

There are five components on this screen:

1. `FilterableProductTable` (grey) contains the entire app.
2. `SearchBar` (blue) receives the user input.
3. `ProductTable` (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input.
4. `ProductCategoryRow` (green) displays a heading for each category.
5. `ProductRow` (yellow) displays a row for each product.

## Hirearchy

- FilterableProductTable
  - SearchBar
  - ProductTable
     - ProductCategoryRow
     - ProductRow

## Why split the UI into components?

### We could have just one component which renders the entire UI. But having a hierarchy has several benifits:

- **Single Responsibility** Each component is doing exactly one task. If some part of the UI is not working correctly we can easily pin point to it.
- **Better Maintainability & Readability** One big component with thousands of line of code is hard to read, understand and maintain.
- **Easier debugging and testing** Small, isolated components are very easy to debug and test.
- **Reusability** Components like buttons, modals, cards, and tables can be used multiple times across the app reducing code duplication.
- **Performance** Large components often re-render unnecessarily, even when only a small part changes.
