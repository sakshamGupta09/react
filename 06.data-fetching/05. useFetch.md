# [react-fetch-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fetch-hook)

- `useFetch` accepts the same arguments as fetch function.
- We do not have to manually mange states like loading, error amd data.

```tsx
  const { isLoading, error, data } = useFetch<Post[]>(
    "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
  );
```


## Depends

- By default the request is triggered only once. Even if component renders again, request will not be triggered.
- The request will not be called until all elements of depends array be truthy.

```tsx
const {authToken} = useContext(authTokenContext);
const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(false);
const { isLoading, data } = useFetch("https://swapi.co/api/people/1", {
    depends: [!!authToken, someState] // don't call request, if haven't authToken OR someState: false
});
```
