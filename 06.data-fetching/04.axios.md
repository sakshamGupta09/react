# [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

Axios simplifies and abstracts a lot of configurations and boilerplate as compared to fetch.

## Problems with native fetch API

1. No automatic JSON transformation.
2. No request timeout support by default.
3. Doesn’t reject HTTP error statuses (like 404, 500). Even if the response is 404 or 500, it resolves the promise—you have to check manually. Axios automatically throws an error for HTTP statuses outside 2xx range.
4. Built-in request and response interceptors for logging, headers, token injection, etc.
5. No upload/download progress with fetch which axios supports.
