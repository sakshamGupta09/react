# useRef

- A component should remember some information across renders.
- Updating that information should not trigger new renders.
- Which simply means this information is not relevant for UI and UI does not need to update when this information updates.


## How to use refs

- Call the hook with initial value.
- It returns an object which has a property current that refers to the value.

```tsx
const ref = useRef(0);

{ 
  current: 0 // The value you passed to useRef
}
```
