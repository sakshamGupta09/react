# You Might Not Need an Effect

## You donâ€™t need Effects to transform data for rendering.

- Data transformations should be done in the top level of components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
- Whenever state changes, React calls the function to calculate what it needs to display on screen. It then commits the changes to the DOM and updates the screen. Then it runs the effect. Now if we again set state in an effect the process restarts from scratch which is inefficient.


## You donâ€™t need Effects to handle user events. 

- User interactions must be handled in an event handler.


## Updating state based on props or state 

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  // âœ… Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```

- When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, donâ€™t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering.
- This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for fullName, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect.
