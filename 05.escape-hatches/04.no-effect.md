# You Might Not Need an Effect

## 1. Updating state based on props or state 

- We have a component that has some state or props.
- We want to transform these values before rendering them. And when the values change, this computed value should update too.
- We might think of having a new state variable and updating it inside an effect.

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```

- This is inefficient.
- When we set `firstName` variable from 'Taylor' to 'Mark', a render will be queued. During this render we will ask React to give us updated values of all three state variables. The value of `lastName` and `userName` remains unchanged.
- So, React will give us `Mark`, `Swift` and `Taylor Swift`.
- React will render the component with new firstName value and stale userName value.
- Then after updating the screen, React will run the effect which calculates and sets the state variable userName.
- This schedules another render and will get the latest value of username this time.

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  // âœ… Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```

- When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, donâ€™t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering.
- Whenever the state gets updated it will automatically transform the values based on latest state or props.



### 2. Caching expensive calculations 

- Derived values should be computed during rendering.
- But what if we have an expensive calculation? Since we are doing computations during rendering, this will always run even if unrelated state has updated.
- Effect provided us a way to only run if dependencies have changed.
- In that case we can memoize or cache the results of expensive calculation and some dependencies too using `useMmemo`.

```tsx
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // âœ… Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```


## 3. Resetting all state when a prop changes 

- A component has some state and accepts props. Whenever props change, we need to reset all state.
- Consider we have a chat component which accepts a userId and sends a message to that user.
- Message is stored in a state variable.
- Now, when the userId changes, we need to clear the message.


```tsx
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setComment('');
  }, [userId]);
  // ...
}
```


### Why not effect

- Whenever the `userId` prop changes, component will render and all it's children too with a stale value of `message` and then effect sets the `message` as empty which triggers another render.
- We might have nested components wihich are also holding state. We need to write this effect in all child components too.


### Solution

```tsx
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  return (
    <Profile
      userId={userId}
      key={userId}
    />
  );
}

function Profile({ userId }) {
  // âœ… This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');
  // ...
}
```
- We can tell React that each message component is conceptually a different message by giving it an explicit key.
- Whenever the key changes, React will recreate the component and reset it's state and all of it's children.


## 4. Adjusting some state when a prop changes 

- Sometimes we do not want to reset entire state of a component but a part of it.
- Example we haave a component List which accepts list items as prop and maintains selectedItem as a state.
- Whenever the items prop changes, we want to reset selectedItem to null.


### Why not effect

```tsx
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelection(null);
  }, [items]);
  // ...
}
```

- When the prop changes, React will render List and all it's children with a stale value of selection.
- After updating DOM, React will run the effect.
- Effect sets the state which again renders list and all it's children.

### Solution

```tsx
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // Better: Adjust the state while rendering
  const [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items);
  if (items !== prevItems) {
    setPrevItems(items);
    setSelection(null);
  }
  // ...
}
```

- When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering.
- Although this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldnâ€™t need it either.
- Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead.

```tsx
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
  // âœ… Best: Calculate everything during rendering
  const selection = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId) ?? null;
  // ...
}
```


## 5. Sharing logic between event handlers 

- Code that needs to run as a result of user interactions should be put inside an event handler.
- Code that runs because component was displayed to the user should be an effect.
- When you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is what kind of logic it is from the userâ€™s perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If itâ€™s caused by the user seeing the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect.
- Let's say we have a Form component that sends two kind of requests.
- It sends an analytics event when it mounts. When you fill in the form and click the Submit button, it will send a POST request to the /api/register endpoint.
- The anaytics request should be made in an effect because it runs after something is displayed to the user.
- The second request should be an event handler because user pressed the submit button.

BAD

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  // âœ… Good: This logic should run because the component was displayed
  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });
  }, []);

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  const [jsonToSubmit, setJsonToSubmit] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (jsonToSubmit !== null) {
      post('/api/register', jsonToSubmit);
    }
  }, [jsonToSubmit]);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setJsonToSubmit({ firstName, lastName });
  }
  // ...
}
```

GOOD

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  // âœ… Good: This logic runs because the component was displayed
  useEffect(() => {
    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' });
  }, []);

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // âœ… Good: Event-specific logic is in the event handler
    post('/api/register', { firstName, lastName });
  }
  // ...
}
```


## 6. Initializing the application 

- Some logic should only run once when the app loads not component but entire application.

```tsx
function App() {
  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once
  useEffect(() => {
    loadDataFromLocalStorage();
    checkAuthToken();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```
- However, youâ€™ll quickly discover that it runs twice in development. This can cause issues.
- In general, your components should be resilient to being remounted. 

```tsx
let didInit = false;

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!didInit) {
      didInit = true;
      // âœ… Only runs once per app load
      loadDataFromLocalStorage();
      checkAuthToken();
    }
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

```tsx
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.
   // âœ… Only runs once per app load
  checkAuthToken();
  loadDataFromLocalStorage();
}

function App() {
  // ...
}
```

- Code at the top level runs once when your component is importedâ€”even if it doesnâ€™t end up being rendered.
- Keep app-wide initialization logic to root component modules like App.js or in your applicationâ€™s entry point.


## 7. Notifying parent components about state changes 

- We have a parent child relationship. Both parent and child owns state. Whenever state is modified in child we want to notify parent so that it can update it's state as well.
- We have a Toggle component which has it's internal state `isOn`. Parent also has some state.

```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    onChange(isOn);
  }, [isOn, onChange]);

  function handleClick() {
    setIsOn(!isOn);
  }
```
- First we set the state of child which triggeres a render. After screen is updated we call the parent's handler which updates parent's state and it also renders.
- There are two render pass.


```tsx
  function handleClick() {
    const nextState = !isOn;

    setIsOn(nextState);
    onChange(nextState);
  }
```
- Both child and parent updates their state during event handler. batches updates from different components together.
- There will only be a single render pass.


```tsx
// âœ… Also good: the component is fully controlled by its parent
function Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) {
  function handleClick() {
    onChange(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      onChange(true);
    } else {
      onChange(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

- We could completely remove state from child component.
- Whenever we have to synchronize two states, we can try lifting the state up to have a single source of truth.


## 8. Passing data to the parent 

- Child component fetches some data and passes it to the parent.

```tsx
function Parent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  // ...
  return <Child onFetched={setData} />;
}

function Child({ onFetched }) {
  const data = useSomeAPI();
  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (data) {
      onFetched(data);
    }
  }, [onFetched, data]);
  // ...
}
```

- React follows top down data flow. We always have one stateful component that manages data and passes it down to its children.
- Since we have a single sorce of truth, tomorrow if anything goes wrong we know where to make the fix.
- But if child component starts updating parent states, the data flow becomes very difficult to debug.
- Let the parent fetch data and pass to children as props.

```tsx
function Parent() {
  const data = useSomeAPI();
  // ...
  // âœ… Good: Passing data down to the child
  return <Child data={data} />;
}

function Child({ data }) {
  // ...
}
```


## 9. Subscribing to an external store

- Sometimes our components need to subscribe to an external data like some browser API.
- We have a browser API which tells us if the user is online or not.
- We generally write such code in an effect.

```tsx
  // Not ideal: Manual store subscription in an Effect
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function updateState() {
      setIsOnline(navigator.onLine);
    }

    updateState();

    window.addEventListener('online', updateState);
    window.addEventListener('offline', updateState);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', updateState);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', updateState);
    };
  }, []);
```

- Although itâ€™s common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. 

```tsx
function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}

function useOnlineStatus() {
  // âœ… Good: Subscribing to an external store with a built-in Hook
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe, // React won't resubscribe for as long as you pass the same function
    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client
    () => true // How to get the value on the server
  );
}

function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  // ...
}
```
