# You Might Not Need an Effect

## You donâ€™t need Effects to transform data for rendering.

- Data transformations should be done in the top level of components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
- Whenever state changes, React calls the function to calculate what it needs to display on screen. It then commits the changes to the DOM and updates the screen. Then it runs the effect. Now if we again set state in an effect the process restarts from scratch which is inefficient.
