# Effects

## Why effects

- There are two kind of logics inside a React component rendering and event handlers.
- Rendering is where React invokes our component and tries to figure out what to display on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. No side effects or communication with external systems.
- Event handlers are triggered as a result of user interactions. They are the best place to cause side effects.
- However, sometimes this is not enough. Consider a component that connects to a server whenever it's visible on the screen.
- We cannot connect to server during rendering as it's a side effect.
- Also, there is no event that causes this component to be visible on screen.


## Effects

- Till now, we were causing side effects only in event handlers in response to a user interaction.
- Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event.
- Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates.
- React tells us that it is done updating the screen and asks us if we want to perform any side effect in response to that.
