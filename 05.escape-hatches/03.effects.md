# Effects

- There are two kind of logic inside a component rendering and event handlers.
- Rendering is where React imvokes our component and tries to figure out what to display on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. No side effects or communication with external systems.
- Event handlers are triggered as a result of user interactions. They are the best place to cause side effects.
- However, sometimes this is not enough. Consider a component that connects to a server whenever it's visible on the screen.
- We cannot connect to server during rendering as it's a side effect.
- Also, there is no event that causes this component to be visible on screen.
- **Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event.**
