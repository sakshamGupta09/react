# Manipulating the DOM with Refs

- React automatically updates the DOM with the render output that we return from a component.
- Our focus should be on returning the right JSX output and React handles the rest for us.
- But sometimes we might need to access DOM nodes to handle some scenarios like to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. 


## Getting a ref to the node 

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

const myRef = useRef(null);

<div ref={myRef}>

```

## When React attaches the refs 

- In React, every update is split in two phases
- During render, React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen.
- During commit, React applies changes to the DOM.
- In general, you don’t want to access refs during rendering.
- During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so ref.current will be null.
- And during the rendering of updates, the DOM nodes haven’t been updated yet. So it’s too early to read them.
- After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.
