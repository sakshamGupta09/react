# Manipulating the DOM with Refs

- React automatically updates the DOM with the render output that we return from a component.
- Our focus should be on returning the right JSX output and React handles the rest for us.
- But sometimes we might need to access DOM nodes to handle some scenarios like to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. 


## Getting a ref to the node 

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

const myRef = useRef(null);

<div ref={myRef}>

```
