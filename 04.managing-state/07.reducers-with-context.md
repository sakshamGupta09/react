# Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

- Previously we learned how to use context to pass data deep down the component tree.
- But what if the child components want to update the context value. How do we do that?


## Problem with Reducers

- A reducer helps keep the event handlers short and concise.
- However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty.
- The state and dispatch functions can be declared at the top component level, but components deep down might need them. So again the prop drilling.


## Combining reducer with context

- Reducers gives us a state variable and a dispatch method. Now we need to pass them to child components.
- We can create two seperate contexts one for state and other for dispatch function.


## Step 1: Create the context 

```tsx
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const TasksContext = createContext(null);
export const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null);

```


## Step 2: Put state and dispatch into context 

```tsx
import { TasksContext, TasksDispatchContext } from './TasksContext.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);
  // ...
  return (
    <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>
      <TasksDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
        ...
      </TasksDispatchContext.Provider>
    </TasksContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

## Step 3: Use context anywhere in the tree 

```tsx
export default function TaskList() {
  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);
  // ...
```
