# Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

- Context let's a component pass some information to it's subtree.
- Reducers are used to manage complex state.
- We can combine context and reducers to manage state of a complex screen. The reducer state and dispatch functions can be passed to distant components using context.


## Problems with reducer

- Reducer state and dispatch function are available at top level components.
- We need to pass them to distanct components via props. This can again lead to prop drilling.
- We can use context to make state and dispatch functions available to distant components without passing props.
