# Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

- Previously we learned how to use context to pass data deep down the component tree.
- But what if the child components want to update the context value. How do we do that?


## Problem with Reducers

- A reducer helps keep the event handlers short and concise.
- However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty.
- The state and dispatch functions can be declared at the top component level, but components deep down might need them. So again the prop drilling.
