# Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

- Context let's a component pass some information to it's subtree.
- Reducers are used to manage complex state.
- We can combine context and reducers to manage state of a complex screen.


## Problems with reducer

- Reducer state and dispatch function are available at top level components.
- To let other components read and update state, We need to pass them via props. This can again lead to prop drilling.
- We can use context to make state and dispatch functions available to distant components without passing props.

```tsx
<TaskList
  tasks={tasks}
  onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
  onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
/>
```

```tsx
<Task
  task={task}
  onChange={onChangeTask}
  onDelete={onDeleteTask}
/>
```
