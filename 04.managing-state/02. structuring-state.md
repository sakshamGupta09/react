# Principles for structuring state 

## 1. Group related state 

```tsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);

const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

```

- If two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable.
- That way we will not forget to update all states together.
- Another case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need.
- For example, it’s helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields.

## 2. Avoid contradictions in state 

- Consider combinations for state variables and remove impossible combinations.
- Example consider a hotel feedback form which has following state structure.

```tsx
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
```
- Here both `isSending` and `isSent` cannot be true at same time.


## 3. Avoid redundant state 

```tsx
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
```

- If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.
- You can always calculate fullName from firstName and lastName during render, so remove it from state.

## Don’t mirror props in state 

```tsx
function Message({ messageColor }) {
  const [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor);
}

function Message({ messageColor }) {
  const color = messageColor;
}
```
- Here, a color state variable is initialized to the messageColor prop.
- The problem is that if the parent component passes a different value of messageColor later (for example, 'red' instead of 'blue'), the color state variable would not be updated! The state is only initialized during the first render.
- Instead use a local variable. In this way everytime parent passes a new value, this variable will update.


## 4.Avoid duplication in state
