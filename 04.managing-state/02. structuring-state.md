# Principles for structuring state 

## 1. Group related state 

```tsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);

const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

```

- You might sometimes be unsure between using a single or multiple state variables.
- If two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable.
- That way we will not forget to update all states.
