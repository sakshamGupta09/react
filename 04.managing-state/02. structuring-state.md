# Principles for structuring state 

## Group related state 

EXAMPLE - 1

```tsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);
```

```tsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

EXAMPLE - 2

```tsx
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
```

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({ firstName: '', lastName: '' });
```

- Should we use a single state variable or multiple?
- If two state variables are always changing together, we should unify them into a single state variable.
