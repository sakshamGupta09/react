# Principles for structuring state 

## Group related state 

EXAMPLE - 1

```tsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);
```

```tsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

EXAMPLE - 2

```tsx
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
```

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({ firstName: '', lastName: '' });
```

- Should we use a single state variable or multiple?
- If two state variables are always changing together, we should unify them into a single state variable.



## Avoid contradictions in state 

- There should not be any combination of state variables which makes no logical sense or is not handled by the UI.
- If there is some combination, unify those state variables into a single variable.
- Consider a hotel feedback form with `isSending` and `isSent` state variables.
- Both of them cannot be true at the same time.
- Since `isSending` and `isSent` should never be true at the same time, it is better to replace them with one status state variable that may take one of three valid states: 'typing' (initial), 'sending', and 'sent'.


## Avoid redundant state 

- If we can calculate some information from component's props or existing state during rendering, then that information should not be a state.
- Because everytime component rerenders it will agian calculate fresh value.
- Example we have two input fields for firstname and lastname and we want to greet user by fullname.
- Fullname can be calculated using firstname and lastname state variables. Hence it should not be a state variable.

```tsx
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
```
