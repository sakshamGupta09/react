# Principles for structuring state 

## 1. Group related state 

```tsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);

const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

```

- If two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable.
- That way we will not forget to update all states together.
- Another case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need.
- For example, it’s helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields.
