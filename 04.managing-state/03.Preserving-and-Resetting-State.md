# Preserving and Resetting State

- React builds render trees for the component structure in your UI.
- When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React.
- Imagine we have a render tree of many components all of which have state. How does React know which state belongs to which component?
- React maps the state with correct component based on component's position in the render tree.
- So when a component rerenders, React compares the component and it's position from previous render tree and preserves it if it is same.
- The structure of the tree should be exactly same across renders if we need to preserve state between renders.



```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}
```
- If we think in terms of render tree, We have `App` component which renders a `div` which has two children `Counter`.
- But the `Counter` component is same. Why they don't share state?
- These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. For React only position in render tree is important. Since these two occupy different positions, they both will have isolated and private state.
- In React, each component on the render tree has fully isolated state. 



## Resetting state

```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

function Counter() {
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [hover, setHover] = useState(false);

  let className = 'counter';
  if (hover) {
    className += ' hover';
  }

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}
      onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)}
    >
      <h1>{score}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}>
        Add one
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- React will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree.
- If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state.
- When we increment `count`, component renders again. But since same component always renders in the same place in render tree, React will always preserve the state.
- Now imagine we are conditionally rendering the second `Counter`.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const [showB, setShowB] = useState(true);
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      {showB && <Counter />} 
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showB}
          onChange={e => {
            setShowB(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Render the second counter
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- When React removes a component, it destroys its state.
- When we render this component again, it's state are reinitialized and added to DOM.


## Same component at the same position preserves state 

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      {isFancy ? (
        <Counter isFancy={true} /> 
      ) : (
        <Counter isFancy={false} /> 
      )}
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isFancy}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsFancy(e.target.checked)
          }}
        />
        Use fancy styling
      </label>
    </div>
  );
}

```

- When we change the checkbox, the component renders again. But since same component renders at the same position React will preserve it's state.

## Different components at the same position reset state 

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      {isPaused ? (
        <p>See you later!</p> 
      ) : (
        <Counter /> 
      )}
```

- Initially The render tree has a `div` which renders a `counter`.
- During next render, when we update the state, the `div` now renders a `p` as it's child.
- Durig rerenders we learn that Different component are rendered at same place which resets state.
- When a component is removed, it's state is destoyed. Next time when it comes to screen, it's state will be reinitialized.
- [Diagram](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#different-components-at-the-same-position-reset-state)


```tsx
  const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      {isFancy ? (
        <div>
          <Counter isFancy={true} /> 
        </div>
      ) : (
        <section>
          <Counter isFancy={false} />
        </section>
      )}
```

- Initially the `div` renders a section which has a `Counter`.
- When state is updated, the `div` now renders another `div` which renders the `Counter`.
- When the section was removed, it's entire subtree was also removed and destroyed.
- Different component is rendered at same place. Hence state is destroyed.
- [Diagram](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#different-components-at-the-same-position-reset-state)
- As a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another
