# Preserving and Resetting State

- To control when to preserve state and when to reset it between re-renders.
- React builds render trees for the component structure in your UI.
- When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React.
- Imagine we have a render tree of many components all of which have state. How does React know which state belongs to which component?
- React maps the state with correct component based on component's position in the render tree.
- If the position of a component in render tree changes, React will reset the state else it will always preserve it.



```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}
```
- If we think in terms of render tree, We have `App` component which renders a `div` which has two children `Counter`.
- But the `Counter` component is same. Why they don't share state?
- These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. For React only position in render tree is important. Since these two occupy different positions, they both will have isolated and private state.
- In React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state.
