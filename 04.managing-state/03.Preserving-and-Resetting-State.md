# Preserving and Resetting State

- To control when to preserve state and when to reset it between re-renders.
- React builds render trees for the component structure in your UI.
- When you give a component state, you might think the state “lives” inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React.
- Imagine we have a render tree of many components all of which have state. How does React know which state belongs to which component?
- React maps the state with correct component based on component's position in the render tree.
- If the position of a component in render tree changes, React will reset the state else it will always preserve it.


```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}
```
