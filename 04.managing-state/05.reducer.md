# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

## Why

- Components that have many state updates spread across multiple event handlers are hard to read, maintain and debug.
- If some issue arises we need to check multiple handlers which updated the state.
- For example consider a todo application where we need to add, remove, mark completed and update title.
- With reducers, All state update logic resides in one place and outside our component so component becomes lean and decluttered.


## How to work with reducers

## Step 1: Declare and dispatch Actions

- State will not be set in the component.
- User interacts with our page and as a result of interaction, we just tell React what user just did by dispatching action object.
- The object we pass to dispatch function is called an Action.
- It can take any shape, but by convention it should have a `type` field which tells us about what user just did.

```tsx
import { ITask } from "./task";

export enum ACTION_TYPES {
  "ADD_TASK" = "add_task",
  "DELETE_TASK" = "delete_task",
  "UPDATE_TASK" = "update_task",
}

type ACTIONTYPE =
  | { type: ACTION_TYPES.ADD_TASK; payload: string }
  | { type: ACTION_TYPES.DELETE_TASK; payload: number }
  | { type: ACTION_TYPES.UPDATE_TASK; payload: ITask };

```


## Step 2: Write a reducer function 

- The logic to update state resides inside a reducer function.
- It takes two arguments current state and action Object and it return the next state.
- React will set the state to what you return from the reducer.

```tsx

export default function TaskReducer(
  tasks: ITask[],
  action: ACTION_TYPE
): ITask[] {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ACTION_TYPES.ADD_TASK: {
      const newTask: ITask = {
        id: tasks.length,
        text: action.payload,
        done: false,
      };
      return [...tasks, newTask];
    }

    case ACTION_TYPES.DELETE_TASK: {
      return tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== action.payload);
    }

    case ACTION_TYPES.UPDATE_TASK: {
      return tasks.map((task) => {
        if (task.id === action.payload.id) {
          return action.payload;
        }
        return task;
      });
    }
    default: {
      return tasks;
    }
  }
}

```

## Step 3: Use the reducer from your component 

```tsx
const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);
```

- Takes two arguments `Reducer` function and `initial state`.
- Returns an array of two values. Stateful variable and a dispatch function.
