# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

- Some components can have many state updates across multiple event handlers.
- Component like this can be hard to read, debug and maintain.
- We consolidate tall the he state update logic into a speerate function that lives outside of our component.
- Instead of multiple set state calls spread across different handlers in our component, we have one central place to update our state. This function is also isolated from our component.
