# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

## Why

- Components that have many state updates spread across multiple event handlers are hard to read, maintain and debug.
- If some issue arises we need to check multiple handlers which updated the state.
- For example consider a todo application where we need to add, remove, mark completed and update title.
- With reducers, All state update logic resides in one place and outside our component so component becomes lean and decluttered.


## How to work with reducers

## Step 1: Declare and dispatch Actions

- State will not be set in the component.
- User interacts with our page and as a result of interaction, we just tell React what user just did by dispatching action object.
- The object we pass to dispatch function is called an Action.
- It can take any shape, but by convention it should have a `type` field which tells us about what user just did.
