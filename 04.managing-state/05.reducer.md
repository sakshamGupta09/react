# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

## Why

- Components that have many state updates spread across multiple event handlers are hard to read, maintain and debug.
- If some issue arises we need to check multiple handlers which updated the state.
- With reducers, All state update logic resides in one place and outside our component.
