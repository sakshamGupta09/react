# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

- Some components can have many state updates across multiple event handlers.
- Component like this can be hard to read, debug and maintain as state is getting updated from multiple places inside a component.
- We consolidate all the state update logic into a central place (a reducer function) that lives outside of our component.
- Instead of scattered state update logic across the component, we have one central place to update our state. This function is also isolated from our component.
