# Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

- Some components can have many state updates across multiple event handlers.
- Component like this can be hard to read, debug and maintain as state is getting updated from multiple places inside a component.
- We consolidate all the state update logic into a central place (a reducer function) that lives outside of our component.
- Instead of scattered state update logic across the component, we have one central place to update our state. This function is also isolated from our component.


## How to use reducers

## Step 1: Move from setting state to dispatching actions 

- State is not set directly in the component.
- We just dispatch actions from a component which tells what a user just did.

```tsx
function handleAddTask(text) {
  dispatch({
    type: 'added',
    id: nextId++,
    text: text,
  });
}
```

- The object you pass to dispatch is called an “action”.
- By convention, it should have a `type` field that tells us what the user just did.
