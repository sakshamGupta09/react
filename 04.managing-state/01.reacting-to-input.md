# Reacting to Input with State

## How to architect a component which changes it's content based on user interactions.

Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer:

- When you type something into the form, the “Submit” button becomes enabled.
- When you press “Submit”, both the form and the button become disabled, and a spinner appears.
- If the network request succeeds, the form gets hidden, and the “Thank you” message appears.
- If the network request fails, an error message appears, and the form becomes enabled again.
