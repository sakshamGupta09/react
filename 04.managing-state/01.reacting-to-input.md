# Reacting to Input with State


## Ways to handle UI interactions

- As a user interacts with our page, we need to manipulate our UI.
- Think of a data table example whhich fetches records from an externa source and can have searching, sorting creation, updation and deletion functionalities.
- We can do this in two ways. Imperative and declarative.
- Imperative means step by step instructions to do a task. In our example we manually have to manipulate each element in the UI, from a spinner to a button, in response to a user interaction.
- Declarative means what needs to be done than how you do it. React follows declarative. We specify different states in which our component can be in and update those state in response to user interactions. React manages the rest. From rendering to commit and updating screen.


## Thinking about UI declaratively 

- If you have a compnent that updates it's contents based on user interactions, How do we architect such components.
- Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer:
- When you type something into the form, the “Submit” button becomes enabled.
- When you press “Submit”, both the form and the button become disabled, and a spinner appears.
- If the network request succeeds, the form gets hidden, and the “Thank you” message appears.
- If the network request fails, an error message appears, and the form becomes enabled again.

## Step 1: Identify your component’s different visual states 

- First, you need to visualize all the different “states” of the UI the user might see and draw the on a paper.
- **Empty:** Form has a disabled “Submit” button.
- **Typing:** Form has an enabled “Submit” button.
- **Submitting:** Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.
- **Success:** “Thank you” message is shown instead of a form.
- **Error:** Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.
- Create a mock UI for all the different states identified. Control this with a `status` prop. Don't add any logic yet.

## Step 2: Determine what triggers those state changes 

- We have identified different visual states. We need to understand what triggeres transitions between one state to another.
- User interactions, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link. Or Computer inputs, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading.
