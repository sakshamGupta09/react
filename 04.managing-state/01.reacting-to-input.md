# Reacting to Input with State


## Ways to handle UI interactions

- As a user interacts with our page, we need to manipulate our UI.
- This can be done imperatively or declaratively.
- Imperative means giving step by step instructions on how to do a task. So, for every user interaction, we have to write a set of well defined instructions to manipulate the UI. This might work well for small screens, but for complex components it becomes difficult.
- Declarative means what needs to be done instead of specifying how to do it. We just give React our state and React manages the rest. Renderig JSX and updating the screen everything is managed by React. We just give React a state structure.
