# Reacting to Input with State


## Ways to handle UI interactions

- As a user interacts with our page, we need to manipulate our UI.
- Think of a data table example whhich fetches records from an externa source and can have searching, sorting creation, updation and deletion functionalities.
- We can do this in two ways. Imperative and declarative.
- Imperative means step by step instructions to do a task. In our example we manually have to manipulate each element in the UI in response to a user interaction.
- Declarative means what needs to be done than how you do it. React follows declarative. We specify different states in which our component can be in and update those state in response to user interactions. React manages the rest. From rendering to commit and updating screen.


## Thinking about UI declaratively 

- If you have a compnent that updates it's contents based on user interactions, How do we architect such components.
