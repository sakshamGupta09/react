# Passing Data Deeply with Context

## Prop Drilling

- Imagine multiple components in the UI tree located at different levels needs access to same information.
- React recommends lifting the state up to a common ancestor.
- But by doing that we might have a scenario where the top most component has some information and we need to pass it to the child nodes via props.
- This is verbose and inconvinient.

## Context

- Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it without passing it explicitly via props.
