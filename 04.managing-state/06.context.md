# Passing Data Deeply with Context

## Prop Drilling

- Imagine multiple components in the UI tree located at different levels needs access to same information(like permissions, theme, locale etc).
- React recommends lifting the state up to a common ancestor.
- But by doing that we might have a scenario where the top most component has some information and we need to pass it to the child nodes via props.
- This is verbose and inconvinient.

## Context

- Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it.


## Step 1: Create the context 

```tsx
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const LevelContext = createContext(1);

```
