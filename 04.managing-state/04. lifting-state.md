# Sharing State Between Components

- Sometimes, state changes in one component affects other components.
- In that case we remove the state from components and put it in their closest common parent.
- Then we pass this state and event handlers to child components as props. Since state is now in parent but interaction happens in child, parent passes an event handler to children, so they can modify parent's state.

## Example

- Let's say we have an `Accordian` component which renders two panels.
- `Panel` component has a state called `isActive` which controls the expanded or collapsed behavior.
- Now, let's say we want ony one panel should be active at one time.
- Now changing state of one panel is affecting other, so we have to lift the state up.
- `Accordian` will now pass `isActive` state and an event handler to update that state as props.

```tsx
export default function Accordian() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(-1);

  function handleClick(index: number) {
    setActiveIndex(index);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="Collapsible panel 1"
        isActive={activeIndex == 0}
        onChange={() => handleClick(0)}
      >
        <p>
          With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
          city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
        </p>
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Collapsible panel 2"
        isActive={activeIndex == 1}
        onChange={() => handleClick(1)}
      >
        <p>
          With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest
          city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
        </p>
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Controlled and uncontrolled components 

- Uncontrolled components are the ones who have state. Uncontrolled because parent component cannot influence it's behavior.
- In a controlled component, the important information is driven by props not state. Parent component has complete control over the behavior of child component.
