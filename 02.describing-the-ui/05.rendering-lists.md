# Rendering Lists

- We have an array and we want to render some component for every item in the array.
- We need to transfrom our array of data into array of components. `Map` is the common way to do that.


## Steps

- Create an array of data. Sometimes it's possible that we already have that data coming from a REST API.

```tsx
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario JosÃ© Molina-Pasquel HenrÃ­quez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];
```
- Transfrom the data array to an array of JSX nodes using map operator.

```tsx
const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);
```
- Render the transfromed array.

```tsx
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```
