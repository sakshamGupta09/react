# Rendering Lists

- We have an array and we want to render some component for every item in the array.
- We need to transfrom our array of data into array of components. `Map` is the common way to do that.


## Steps

- Create an array of data. Sometimes it's possible that we already have that data coming from a REST API.

```tsx
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];
```
- Transfrom the data array to an array of JSX nodes using map operator.

```tsx
const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);
```
If we have multiple nodes to return

```tsx
  const listItems = people.map((person) => (
    <li>
      <h2>{person.name}</h2>
      <p>{person.profession}</p>
    </li>
  ));
```

- Render the transfromed array.

```tsx
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```


## Filtering arrays of items 

- Since when we transform an array we transform all the elements.
- So, if we need to filter out some elements, we have to use `filter` with `map`.

```tsx
const chemists = people.filter(person =>
  person.profession === 'chemist'
);

const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>
     <img
       src={getImageUrl(person)}
       alt={person.name}
     />
     <p>
       <b>{person.name}:</b>
       {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
       known for {person.accomplishment}
     </p>
  </li>
);

return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```


## Keeping list items in order with key 

- Every array item (JSX Node) should have a unique identifier `key` which can identify it from other items.
- We created an array of JSX nodes and React rendered that list.
- Keys help React to maintain a mapping betwwen the rendered component and array item.
- If our array items can move due to sorting, reverse, insertion, deletion etc React will have to tear down the entire list and recreate. This is bad for performance.
- Instead if we have keys, React can tell what has changed exactly and it updates the DOM accordingly.
- React can tell based on updated array item which component it needs to update.

## Displaying several DOM nodes for each list item 

- What do you do when each item needs to render not one, but several DOM nodes?
- The short `<>...</>` Fragment syntax won’t let you pass a key.
- So we need to either group them into a single `<div>`, or use the slightly longer and more explicit `<Fragment>` syntax:

```tsx
import { Fragment } from 'react';

// ...

const listItems = people.map(person =>
  <Fragment key={person.id}>
    <h1>{person.name}</h1>
    <p>{person.bio}</p>
  </Fragment>
);
```
