# Rendering Lists

- We have a collection of data like an array.
- For every item, we want to display some JSX on the screen.
- React can easily render array of JSX elements.
- But we do not have array of JSX, we have array of data items. So, we need to convert the array of data to array of JSX.
- We use array transform menthods like `map` to convert data to collection of JSX.

```tsx

export default function App() {
  const [people, setPeople] = useState(PEOPLE);

  const listItems = people.map((el) => <li>{el}</li>);

  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```


## Keeping list items in order with key 

- Whenever we render list of JSX, all JSX elements must have a `key` prop.
- This `key` should uniquely identify a list item.
- With the help of keys, React maintains a mapping between the source array and the components we render.
- So that, later if the order of our source array changes, due to sorting, insertion or deletion React does not have to tear down and recreate the list again.
- React will simply perform the minimum DOM updates needed.
