# JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces

- Every webpage has a markup or content that we typically write using HTML.
- React uses JSX to write markup inside a JS file so that rendering logic and content are in a same place.
- Inside our markup, we can access JavaScript using curly braces to invoke functions, assign a dynamic property to attributes etc.
- Whenever we need any JS value inside our markup we need to use curly braces.
