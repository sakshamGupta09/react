# JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces

- Every webpage has a markup or content that we typically write using HTML.
- React uses JSX to write markup inside a JS file so that rendering logic and content are in a same place.
- Inside our markup, we can access any JavaScript value using curly braces.



## Assigning dynamic value to JSX attributes

```tsx
export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
    />
  );
}
```

- JSX has attributes. If we want to assign a string value to JSX attributes, we write it in double or single quotes.
- Here, `https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg` and `Gregorio Y. Zara` are being passed as strings.
- But if you want to dynamically specify the `src` or `alt` text, we need to use curly braces since we are using a JavaScript value.
