# JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces

- Inside a React component, we use JSX to define our markup.
- Most of the time, this markup would not be static and would need to reference some JavaScript variables.


## Passing strings with quotes 

- We can use single or double quotes to assign static string values to our JSX attributes.

```tsx
export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
    />
  );
}
```
