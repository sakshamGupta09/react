# Writing Markup with JSX

- We commonly use HTML to define the contents of our webpage.
- But in a React component, we use JSX to define markup which looks a lot like HTML.


## The Rules of JSX 

### 1. Return a single root element.

This syntax is invalid as it returns multiple elements.

```tsx
  return (
      <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
      <img
        src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg"
        alt="Hedy Lamarr"
        className="photo"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
        <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
        <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
      </ul>
  );
```

To fix this we can wrap them inside a parent element.

```tsx
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Fragments

- We do not want to add an extra element to the DOM just for the sake of clubbing elements.
- In that case we can use fragments which do not render anything to the DOM.

```tsx
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
```
