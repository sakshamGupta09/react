# Writing Markup with JSX

- We need a markup language like HTML to define the content of our webpage.
- React uses JSX to define markup in JS file.

## JSX: Putting markup into JavaScript 

- The Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- For many years, web developers used different files to place content, design and logic. Content in html file, designs in css files and logic in js files.
- But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. The markup was decided by logic. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML!
- This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same placeâ€”components.
