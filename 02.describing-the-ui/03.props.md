# Passing Props to a Component

- Parent component can pass some information to it's children.
- We can pass any JavScript value as props including objects, arrays, functions etc.
- This is similar to passing attributes to HTML elements or JSX tags like `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`.

```tsx
<img
 className="avatar"
 src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
 alt="Lin Lanying"
 width={100}
 height={100}
/>
```

## Step 1: Pass props to the child component 

```tsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Read props inside the child component 

- Child component receives an object always which has keys as the props passed by the parent.
- We can destructure the props and use them as regular variables.

```tsx
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```


## Specifying a default value for a prop 

- What happens if the parent does not pass a prop to a child component but child component's functionality depends on that prop.
- We can specify a default value for our props.
- Default value will be used if parent does not specify the value or if the value is `undefined`. But if you pass `size={null}` or `size={0}`, the default value will not be used.


## Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax 

```tsx
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Some components forward all their props to their children.
- Passing props this way can become repititive and any change needs to be made at multiple places.
- In sunch scenarios where a component forwards all the props it receives we can use a spread operator.

```tsx
function Profile(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
- Note that we don not destructure in this case. As parent does not read this information just passes down to children.


## Passing JSX as children 

```tsx
<div>
  <img />
</div>

<Card>
  <Avatar />
</Card>
```

- It is common to nest built in browser tags. We can do the same with custom components.
- Parent wants to send some content or JSX to it's children.
- When we nest content inside a component tag, we receive that content in a special prop called `children`.
- You can think of a component with a children prop as having a “hole” that can be “filled in” by its parent components with arbitrary JSX.


## How props change over time 

- A component may receive different props over time.
- However, props are immutable. They are readonly with respect to a component.
- When a component wants new props, it has to ask it's parent to provide a new object.
- Every render receives a new version of props.
