# Passing Props to a Component

- Parent component can pass some information to it's children.
- We can pass any JavScript value as props including objects, arrays, functions etc.
- This is similar to passing attributes to HTML elements or JSX tags like `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`.
