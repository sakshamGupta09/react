# Passing Props to a Component

- Parent component can pass some information to it's children.
- We can pass any JavScript value as props including objects, arrays, functions etc.
- This is similar to passing attributes to HTML elements or JSX tags like `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`.

```tsx
<img
 className="avatar"
 src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
 alt="Lin Lanying"
 width={100}
 height={100}
/>
```

## Step 1: Pass props to the child component 

```tsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```
