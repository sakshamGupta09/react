# Passing Props to a Component

- Parent component wants to send some information to it's chilren components.


## Step 1: Pass props to the child component 

- Parent can pass multiple props to a children.
- All these props are consolidated into an object and passed to the child.
- What child receives is an object which contains all these props sent by parent.

```tsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={person}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Read props inside the child component 

- The child component has received an object in the form of props.
- We destructure this object to extract the individual piecees of information.

```tsx
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```

## Specifying a default value for a prop 

- Parent passes some information to child components.
- What happens if the parent forgets to send that information and it is required in child component.
- In that case we can use default props.
- The default value is only used if we do not the prop or we pass `undefined`. For other falsy values like `null`, `0`, `false`, "" etc. Default value will not be used.

## Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax 

```tsx
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
function Profile(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Some components forward all of their props to their children.
- In that case it makes more sense to use a concise spread syntax than writing repititive code for passing props.
- If the structure of props changes (addition or removal) we have to update that change in multiple places.
