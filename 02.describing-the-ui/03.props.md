# Passing Props to a Component

- Parent component wants to send some information to it's chilren components.


## Step 1: Pass props to the child component 

- Parent can pass multiple props to a children.
- All these props are consolidated into an object and passed to the child.
- What child receives is an object which contains all these props sent by parent.

```tsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={person}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Read props inside the child component 

- The child component has received an object in the form of props.
- We destructure this object to extract the individual piecees of information.

```tsx
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```
