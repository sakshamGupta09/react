# Passing Props to a Component

- Parent component can pass some information to it's children.
- We can pass any JavScript value as props including objects, arrays, functions etc.
- This is similar to passing attributes to HTML elements or JSX tags like `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an `<img>`.

```tsx
<img
 className="avatar"
 src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
 alt="Lin Lanying"
 width={100}
 height={100}
/>
```

## Step 1: Pass props to the child component 

```tsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}
```

## Step 2: Read props inside the child component 

- Child component receives an object always which has keys as the props passed by the parent.
- We can destructure the props and use them as regular variables.

```tsx
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}
```


## Specifying a default value for a prop 

- What happens if the parent does not pass a prop to a child component but child component's functionality depends on that prop.
- We can specify a default value for our props.
- Default value will be used if parent does not specify the value or if the value is `undefined`. But if you pass `size={null}` or `size={0}`, the default value will not be used.
