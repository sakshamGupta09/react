# Conditional Rendering

- Component should display different things based on different conditions.



## Conditionally returning JSX tree

- Return different JSX tree from a component based on different conditions.
- Consider the example of a datatable. While data is loading we want to render a spinner. If there is no data, we want to show no data message else we want to render the data table.
- Can be achieved by using `if` and `return`.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  if (isLoading) {
    return <Loader />;
  }

  if (!isLoading && DataTransfer.length == 0) {
    return <NoData />;
  }

  return <DataTable />;
}
```
