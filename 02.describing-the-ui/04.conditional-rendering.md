# Conditional Rendering

## Conditionally returning JSX 

- Return different JSX tree from a component based on different conditions.
- Consider the example of a datatable. While data is loading we want to render a spinner. If there is no data, we want to show no data message else we want to render the data table.
- Can be achieved by using `if` and `return`.
