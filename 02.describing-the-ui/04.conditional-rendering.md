# Conditional Rendering

- A component might have to display different things based on different conditions.
- Example a spinner, no data found, error screen or data table.
- What are the different ways to do conditional rendering in React ?



## Conditionally returning JSX 

- A component always returns some JSX.
- Using if and return statements, we return different JSX tree based on conditions.
- Use this patter when we want to return different JSX tree from a component.
- Like a spinner, Error page, no data found screen or datatable with filters.

```tsx
if (isPacked) {
  return <li className="item">{name} âœ…</li>;
}
return <li className="item">{name}</li>;
```


## Conditionally returning nothing with null
