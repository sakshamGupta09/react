# Conditional Rendering

- Component should display different things based on different conditions.
- We should be able to render JSX conditionally.



## Conditionally returning JSX tree

- Return different JSX tree from a component based on different conditions.
- Consider the example of a datatable. While data is loading we want to render a spinner. If there is no data, we want to show no data message else we want to render the data table.
- Can be achieved by using `if` and `return`.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  if (isLoading) {
    return <Loader />;
  }

  if (!isLoading && DataTransfer.length == 0) {
    return <NoData />;
  }

  return <DataTable />;
}
```


## Ternary operator

- This style works well for simple conditions,
-  If your components get messy with too much nested conditional markup, consider extracting child components to clean things up. 

```tsx
return (
  <li className="item">
    {isPacked ? name + ' ✅' : name}
  </li>
);
```

## Logical AND operator (&&) 

- Render JSX only if condition is true. Render nothing otherwise.
- It returns the right hand side value if the condition is true. But if the condition is false, the whole expression becomes false.
- React considers `false`, `null` and `undefined` as a hole. Meaning it does not render anything at all.

```tsx
return (
  <li className="item">
    {name} {isPacked && '✅'}
  </li>
);
```
- Don’t put numbers on the left side of &&.
- If the left side is 0, then the whole expression gets that value (0), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing.
- Left hand side must always be a boolean.

```tsx
{ messageCount && <p>New messages</p> }

{ messageCount > 0 && <p>New messages</p>. }


```
