# The Render Tree 

- At a given time on the screen, the UI we see is a combination of multiple components nested within each other.
- Like `header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `devices`, `details`, `filters` etc.
- How can we visualize this UI on the screen, various components, the data flow and the relationship between these components?
- React, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree.
- When a React app is rendered, we can visualize a React app as a tree of components. This makes it easier to plot relationships, understand data flow and rerenders.
- The tree is composed of nodes, each of which represents a component. The render tree is only composed of React components.
- Render trees help identify what the top-level and leaf components are. Top-level components affect the rendering performance of all components beneath them and leaf components are often re-rendered frequently. Identifying them is useful for understanding and debugging rendering performance.
