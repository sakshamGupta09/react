# Understanding Your UI as a Tree

- At a given time on the screen, the UI we see is a combination of multiple components nested within each other.
- Like `header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `devices`, `details`, `filters` etc.
- How can we visualize this component structure that represents UI on the screen, the data flow and the relationship between these components?
- React, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree.
- When a React app is rendered, we can visualize a React app as a tree of components. This makes it easier to plot rrlationships and data flow.


## The Render Tree 

- When we render a React app, we can model the relationship between multiple components in a tree, known as the render tree.
