# Thinking in react

- I want to build UI with React.
- What should be the thought process for building complex UI's with React.

## Start with the mockup 

- Imagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.

``` javascript
[
  { category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Apple" },
  { category: "Fruits", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Dragonfruit" },
  { category: "Fruits", price: "$2", stocked: false, name: "Passionfruit" },
  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$2", stocked: true, name: "Spinach" },
  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$4", stocked: false, name: "Pumpkin" },
  { category: "Vegetables", price: "$1", stocked: true, name: "Peas" }
]
```
