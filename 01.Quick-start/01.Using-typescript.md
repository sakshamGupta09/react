# Using typescript

- TypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases.


## TypeScript with React Components 

- Every file containing JSX must use the .tsx file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX.
- You can provide types for your componentâ€™s props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.
