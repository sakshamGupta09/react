# Step 2: Build a static version in React 

- Render the UI from the data model without adding any interactivity.
- Itâ€™s often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later.
- Use props to pass information from parent to child.
- Don't use state in this step. State is reserved only for interactivity.
