# Step 2: Build a static version in React 

- We now have the component hirearchy with us. Lets try to build a static version of the application wherein we use the data model to render the UI without adding any interactivity.
- Building the static version means implementation of the all the components in the hirearchy.
- You can either build “top down” by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like FilterableProductTable) or “bottom up” by working from components lower down (like ProductRow).
- In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up.
- Use props to pass information from parent to child. Don't use state in this step. State is reserved only for interactivity.
