# Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy 

- Split up a UI design into components based on Single Responsibility Principle and name them appropriately.
- A component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up doing multiple things, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
- Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them
- Then draw the component tree.
