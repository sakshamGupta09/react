# useRef

- To store some information in a component that is not used in rendering logic.
- Since, it is not used in rendering, updating this information should not trigger a new render.
- Component remembers this information across renders just like state but updating it does not trigger a new render.

## Why do we need useRef

- Storing timeout IDs (setTimeout, setInterval).
- Storing and manipulating DOM elements
- Storing other objects that arenâ€™t necessary to calculate the JSX.

## How to use refs

- Import `useRef` from `react`.
- Call the `useRef` hook and provide a initial value.
- Calling this hook returns an object which has a current property whose value is the initial value.
- We can read the value using `ref.current` and we can mutate it also (Mutable not immutable).

``` tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
}
```
