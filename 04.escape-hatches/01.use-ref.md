# useRef

- To store some information in a component that does not impact rendering logic. The component will remember this information but updating it does not trigger new renders.


## Why do we need useRef

- Storing timeout IDs.
- Storing and manipulating DOM elements
- Storing other objects that arenâ€™t necessary to calculate the JSX.
