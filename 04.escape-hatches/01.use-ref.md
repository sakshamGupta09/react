# useRef

- A component should remember some information across renders but updating that information does not trigger renders.
- That means this information is not used for rendering.
- If your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs.


## Why do we need useRef

- Storing timeout IDs.
- Storing and manipulating DOM elements
- Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.
