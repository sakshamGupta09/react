# useRef

- To store some information in a component that does not impact rendering logic.
- The component will remember this information across renders but updating it does not trigger new renders.
- Any information that is not used in rendering but we need it should be stored in a ref.


## Why do we need useRef

- Storing timeout IDs (setTimeout, setInterval).
- Storing and manipulating DOM elements
- Storing other objects that arenâ€™t necessary to calculate the JSX.

## How to use refs

- Import `useRef` from `react`.
- Call the `useRef` hook and provide a initial value.
- Calling this hook returns an object which has a current property whose value is the initial value.
- We can read the value using `ref.current` and we can mutate it also (Mutable not immutable).

``` tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

const ref = useRef(0);

{ 
  current: 0 // The value you passed to useRef
}
```
