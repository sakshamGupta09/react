# useRef

- To store some information in a component that does not impact rendering logic.
- The component will remember this information across renders but updating it does not trigger new renders.


## Why do we need useRef

- Storing timeout IDs (setTimeout, setInterval).
- Storing and manipulating DOM elements
- Storing other objects that arenâ€™t necessary to calculate the JSX.
