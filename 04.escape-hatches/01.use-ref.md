# useRef

- To store some information in a component that is not used in rendering logic and is preserved across renders.
- Since, it is not used in rendering, updating this information should not trigger a new render.
- Don't read the ref variables during rendering as they do not trigger rerenders, they can give a false representation.
- It's always safe to read and update ref values from an event handler.

## Why do we need useRef

- Storing timeout IDs (setTimeout, setInterval).
- Storing and manipulating DOM elements
- Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.

## How to use refs

-  `useRef` hook is a function. We call the function with some intial value.
- Calling this function returns an object which has a current property which holds the information.
- We can read the value using `ref.current` and we can mutate it also (Mutable not immutable) without a setter function.
- Mutating it would not trigger a render.

``` tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### [Differences between refs and state](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs#differences-between-refs-and-state)

- `State` acts like a snapshot for every render and doesn’t update synchronously.
- But when you mutate the current value of a ref, it changes immediately.
