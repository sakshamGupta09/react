# Manipulating the DOM with Refs

- React automatically updates the DOM for us. We just return markup from a component and that markup is added to the DOM by React.
- We do not have to do anything explicitly. So, why are we talking about DOM manipulations ?
- Sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements —for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. 
- There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node and then use browser API's to manipulate them.


## Getting a ref to the node 

- Declare a ref variable by calling the `useRef` function.
- Link it to a DOM node using a special `ref` attribute.
- Whenever React updates the DOM, it will assign a reference to that node to our ref.cuurent.


```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
const myRef = useRef(null);
<div ref={myRef}>
```

## When React attaches the refs 

- In general, you don’t want to access refs during rendering. During the first render, the DOM nodes are not created yet. So, it will point to null. During rendering of updates, React has not updated the DOM nodes yet. So, it would be early to read them.
- Ideally we should always read refs in a event handler.
- React sets ref.current during the commit.
- After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.

## Example: Focusing a text input

```tsx
 const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  function handleFocusClick() {
    inputRef.current?.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleFocusClick}>Focus</button>
    </>
  );
```

## Ref callback

- We have learned that we can assign a `useRef` variable to ref attribute on a DOM node.
- Whenever React creates that node, it assigns a reference of that node to `useRef` variable.
- We can also pass a callback function to ref attribute.
- React will call your ref callback with the `DOM node` when it’s time to set the ref, and with `null` when it’s time to clear it
- 
```tsx
<div ref={(node) => {
  console.log('Attached', node);

  return () => {
    console.log('Clean up', node)
  }
}}>
```

## Manage a list of refs using a ref callback 

- Suppose we have an array and we need a ref to each item of array.
- In that case we would need a collection of refs - array or a map.

```tsx
  const catsRef = useRef(new Map<string, HTMLLIElement>());
  return (
    <ul>
      {catList.map((cat) => (
        <li
          key={cat}
          ref={(node) => {
            catsRef.current.set(cat, node!);
            return () => {
              catsRef.current.delete(cat);
            };
          }}
        >
          <img src={cat} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
```

## Accessing another component’s DOM nodes 

- Let's say a parent component wants to access the DOM node of it's child component.
- We can define the ref variable in the parent component and pass it to child as a prop.
- Then in the child component, we can set the ref attribute of a DOM node to the ref prop.

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyInput({ ref }) {
  return <input ref={ref} />;
}

function MyForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  return <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
}
```

## useImperativeHandle

- Parent component has access to the DOM node of a child component.
- The parent component can do any sort of thing with the DOM node like change it's styles, focus etc.
- We want the parent component to only do certain types of things with the DOM node.


```tsx
function MyInput({ ref }) {
  const realInputRef = useRef(null);
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    // Only expose focus and nothing else
    focus() {
      realInputRef.current.focus();
    },
  }));
  return <input ref={realInputRef} />;
};
```

- Previously, the ref prop passed from parent was linked to a original DOM node.
- Now, the child component has it's own `useRef` that is linked to a DOM node. Parent passed ref is not linked to any DOM node.
- We instruct react to provide a custom object for parent's ref variable. The ref variable in parent will point to the custom object and not real DOM node.
- The child's ref points to the real DOM node whereas parent's ref point to a custom object that we create.


## Flushing state updates synchronously with flushSync 

- Imagine we have a todo application where we add a new todo and scroll to it after a new todo has been added.
- This does not work as expected. It always scrolls to the second last item.

```tsx
    setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
    listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView({
      behavior: 'smooth',
      block: 'nearest'
    });
```


- In react state updates are queued. Meaning calling setState does not set the state immediately but triggers a render.
- So the time you scroll the list to its last element, the todo has not yet been added.
- To fix this issue, you can force React to update (“flush”) the DOM synchronously.
- It tells react to update the DOM synchronously so that we can perform some operations on the new and updated DOM.

```tsx
flushSync(() => {
  setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);
});
listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView();
```
