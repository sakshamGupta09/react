# Manipulating the DOM with Refs

- React automatically updates the DOM for us. We just return a markup from a component and that markup is added to the DOM by React behin the scenes.
- We do not have to do anything explicitly. So, why are we talking about DOM manipulations ?
- Sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by Reactâ€”for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. 
- There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.


## Getting a ref to the node 

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
const myRef = useRef(null);
<div ref={myRef}>
```
- When React creates a DOM node for this `div`, React will put a reference to this node into `myRef.current`.
- You can then access this DOM node from your event handlers and use the built-in browser APIs defined on it.
