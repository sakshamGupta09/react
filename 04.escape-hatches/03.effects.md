# Effects

- Effects run at the end of `commit` after the screen updates.
- To  run some code(side effects) after screen has been updated, we use effects.


## How to write an Effect 

### Step 1: Declare an Effect 

- Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside `useEffect`.
- `useEffect` “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.
