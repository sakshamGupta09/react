# Effects

- Effects run at the end of commit after screen updates.
- If we want to run some code after React has updated the screen, we can use effects.
- By default, effects runs everytime after React updates the screen.


## Step 1: Declare an Effect 

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code here will run after *every* render
  });
  return <div />;
}
```
