# Effects

- Effects run at the end of `commit` after the screen updates.
- To  run some code(side effects) after screen has been updated, we use effects.
- It's like an event which is triggered everytime react updates the screen, and runs our effect code.

## How to write an Effect 

### Step 1: Declare an Effect 

- Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside `useEffect`.
- `useEffect` “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code here will run after *every* render
  });
  return <div />;
}
```
